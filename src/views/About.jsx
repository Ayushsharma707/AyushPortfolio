              Hello, my name is Ayush Sharma, and I am a Computer Science student with a passion for web development. As a self-taught developer, I have built expertise in front-end development and am currently expanding my skills to become a full-stack developer.

              I enjoy creating websites that are easy to use and visually appealing, as it allows me to combine my technical knowledge with creativity. From designing user-friendly interfaces to exploring new features, Iâ€™m always excited to try new ideas and improve.

            </p>
